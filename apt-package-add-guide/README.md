# Add apt package of specific tool in Debian or Ubuntu based system

`apt install -y curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release \
    debian-archive-keyring`
 
is often used during the setup of a Debian or Ubuntu-based system to ensure the environment has the necessary tools and certificates for securely fetching and verifying packages from external repositories. 

#### Here's why each package is included:

* curl:
  
    A command-line tool used for transferring data from or to a server, often needed for downloading files or scripts over HTTP/HTTPS.
    It's commonly used to fetch repository configuration files or scripts during software setup.

* gnupg2:

    Provides tools for working with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys.
    Essential for verifying the authenticity of packages and repository metadata by checking their cryptographic signatures.

* ca-certificates:

    Includes trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates used by the system to verify the SSL/TLS certificates of servers.
    Ensures secure communication when accessing HTTPS endpoints.

* lsb-release:

    A utility that provides information about the Linux distribution version (e.g., Ubuntu or Debian version).
    Useful for scripts that need to adjust behavior based on the operating system version.

* debian-archive-keyring:

    Contains the keys used to verify Debian archive signatures.
    Ensures that downloaded packages are from a trusted Debian source and have not been tampered with.


#### Why This Combination?

    When setting up external repositories or custom software, you often need:

* Secure package fetching (enabled by curl and ca-certificates).

* Verification of repository keys and metadata (handled by gnupg2 and        debian-archive-keyring).

* System compatibility checks (using lsb-release).


  These tools and files collectively ensure secure and reliable system setup, especially when adding third-party repositories or installing software from external sources.
